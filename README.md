    This project leverages PyTorch's MiDaS model and Open3D's point cloud implementation to attempt to create an orthogonal 3D mapping of a scene. The goal of this project is to provide a real-time, accurate, and intuitive representation of the spatial relationships between objects in a given scene.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The project build is tested on Python 3.9 and 3.10. For Mac and Linux environments, it is recommended that you manage your versions with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), or (for the general case) use a [virtual env](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to avoid clashing dependencies with Torch packages.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

First, you need to install the Python requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

To run the model on an image, replace `FILENAME` with the file name (with path and extension) of the image to be used as input. For the `--level` configuration option, input an integer 1-3, 1 being the lowest accuracy with highest inference speed and 3 being highest accuracy with slowest inference speed.

```bash
python3 main.py --level [1|2|3] --image FILENAME
```
